<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">In order to understand the galaxy formation, one needs to first understand inflows and outflows! From the observations we know that there is multiphase and clumpy gas present in galactic outflows such as M82. The question is how do we explain the existence of cool clumps in the galactic outflows. That&apos;s where thermal instability comes in. In brief it refers to the condensation of gas purely due to thermodynamics not gravitation as the radiation pressure would be much higher than the gravitational potential energy density.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Thermal Instability: Small density perturbations cause a runaway heating and cooling which result in condensation of diffuse gas in cooler regions. (assuming the generalised heat loss function is zero)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In galactic outflows due to expansion of the gas the number density of atoms reduces which leads to longer cooling time. In this sense there is a coupling between cooling time scale and expansion time scale. So the problem is to study this coupling.</span></p>
